The conservative social media company Parler announced on Monday that it is being purchased by Kanye West, who was temporarily suspended from Twitter this month for an antisemitic tweet. A statement from Parler’s parent company announcing the deal described West, who has legally changed his name to Ye, as having taken “a groundbreaking move into the free speech media space” where “he will never have to fear being removed from social media again.”

In a release by Parler, West said that “in a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves.”

This development means several social media companies could soon be left in the hands of mercurial, mega-rich men who have pledged to promote “free speech,” including the kind of extreme views that got West temporarily booted from Twitter. Elon Musk is currently in the process of buying Twitter, though Twitter said in a recent court filing that federal authorities (it was not clear which ones) are investigating Musk (while Musk’s attorney said this filing was designed to distract from Twitter’s own legal issues).

For his part, Musk has said Twitter should be “an inclusive arena for free speech.” And former President Donald Trump, who was thrown off Twitter and Facebook in January 2021, founded the company that created Truth Social, which describes itself as a “free speech haven.”

These responses to Kanye West are truly frightening
If West and Musk go through with their deals, these three social media platforms are likely to serve as ecosystems for conservative thought. This will likely make the views of those who remain on them more extreme — which could have a radical effect on our politics. That’s because when people who think similarly come together, they reaffirm and heighten one another’s initial beliefs.

While men such as West, Musk and Trump claim to promote free speech by not favoring the moderation of problematic content, here’s what lack of moderation really does: It drives away the people victimized by abusive content such as West’s tweet.

A 2020 study of women in 51 countries by The Economist Intelligence Unit found that 38% have been victims of online violence, from stalking to doxxing to violent threats. As Amnesty International and others have found, women of color are most affected. Antisemitic content is also rampant online. A 2021 report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate found that a sample of 714 anti-Jewish posts on five social networks had been viewed 7.3 million times.

When women become victims of online hate, they often “shut down their blogs, avoid websites they formerly frequented, take down social networking profiles, (and) refrain from engaging in online political commentary,” according to University of Miami law professor Mary Anne Franks.

In practice, what these so-called free speech policies really boil down to is an ugly form of censorship that scares away the voices of people who are attacked by users of these platforms.

The breathtaking cluelessness of Elon Musk
West has already described Parler as a place where conservative views can flourish, and nonconservatives are unlikely to flock to Truth Social, given its association with Trump. If women, people of color and others start fleeing Twitter, that could leave it as a platform for conservatives as well. This would likely make the views of those who remain even more zealous.

“When like-minded people get together, they often end up thinking a more extreme version of what they thought before they started to talk to one another,” Harvard University law professor Cass Sunstein writes in “On Rumors: How Falsehoods Spread, Why We Believe Them, and What Can Be Done.” Sunstein says this happens because their exchanges heighten their preexisting beliefs and make them more confident.

Trump's Truth Social platform is a slow-motion train wreck
So, when conservatives get together on social media, we can expect them to become more far right. And just as Rush Limbaugh and other conservative talk-show hosts radically altered the political landscape in the 1990s in ways that laid the groundwork for Trump’s presidency, the far-right views nurtured on these social networks could have a huge impact on our country’s politics. It isn’t hard to imagine that the people who commune on these sites could band together to support and elect political candidates who share their worldviews.

We can also expect these male owners to use their platforms to amplify their own views — even when they’re sexist, misogynistic, racist or otherwise hateful.

If West comes to own Parler and Musk takes the reins of Twitter, an already-extant conservative ecosystem will be supercharged on social media. These men’s “free speech” policies are likely to drive away people victimized by hate online. Those who remain in these conservative spaces will become even more extreme as a result of their interactions, which could cultivate a dangerous far-right ideology that has far-reaching effects on our politics.

Just think about the way these owners already post, with Musk recently suggesting China control Taiwan and Russia keep part of Ukraine and West releasing a music video showing a doppelgänger of ex-wife Kim Kardashian’s then-boyfriend, Pete Davidson, being kidnapped and buried.

(CNN) — It's been a year of airport chaos and problems with baggage handling have left many travelers struggling to reunite with their luggage.
Flying with only carry-on is as desirable as ever. But for one traveler, even that isn't minimalist enough. She's hitting the road with only a small, 12-liter (3-gallon) shoulder bag.
Brooke Schoenman is an American woman living in Australia and the publisher of Her Packing List, a website which she uses to pass on her wisdom when it comes to whittling down what to take on the road.
And that's something that she's road-tested almost to the extreme.
Schoenman's path to burden-easing enlightenment began when she studied in Italy before embarking on a post-graduate round-the-world trip. Along the way, she explored Guatemala and later worked teaching English in Ukraine before moving down under 13 years ago.
"I think I had a 55-liter backpack and a day pack that I wore on the front," she tells CNN Travel of her first trip. A 55-liter pack can be the maximum size -- or a little too large -- for a carry-on. "And that was me really trying to pack light. That was me thinking, 'I don't know how people do it with a 30-liter bag.'
"I didn't use all those extra things that I packed."
As she gained more experience as a traveler, she says packing light became more important to her.
"It was literally the carrying of things that started to wear me down. Every time [I'd] have to walk across this airport or find my way to the bus, to the train, to the airport or to the whatever, I would just be like, 'This sucks.'"
This realization was one of the reasons behind starting Her Packing List in 2010. The aim of the website is to help all travelers, but especially women, pack and plan better for their trips through packing guides and insider tips. The website gets its name from the checklists Schoenman says are an important tool in prepping for travel.
'That's all you have?'
Brooke Schoenman has refined her packing techniques since launching a blog on the subject.

"Preparing for [a trip] was the only thing that you could do to bide your time before you got to leave," she says. " So thinking about it and thinking about all the things you could bring and pack, it was exciting."
The website wasn't always about minimalist packing, initially offering advice for travelers checking luggage, but it has evolved over the years as Schoenman herself made do with less.
"When [I] first started the site, I didn't talk all the time about carry-on packing," she says. "It was like you were checking a bag and your carry-on was the stuff you had in the cabin with you that was really valuable or breakable like an extra outfit and an extra pair of underwear, that kind of stuff. And then I started packing lighter."
Schoenman hit her peak in minimalist packing in 2016 when she left for three weeks of international travel with only a 12-liter handbag and a US itinerary that included Portland, Vegas, Chicago, San Francisco and three days on an Amtrak train.
"I got into the Uber on the way to the airport in Sydney," she recalls. "The guy was like, 'Where are you going? What terminal?' And I was like, 'International.' 'Where's your luggage? How long is your trip?' 'Three weeks.' And he's like, 'And that's all you have?' 'Yep.'"
Schoenman says people are "shocked" to learn how minimal they can pack.

Her friends and family were also amused by her lack of baggage. "My mom just sort of laughed when she saw my bag and realized it was all my luggage."
Inside her laptop-sized handbag she packed the essentials. This included a packing cube of clothing that could be worn multiple ways, fold-up shoes, a mini keyboard for her smartphone and small containers of essential toiletries. She visited a wide variety of environments so wardrobe planning was important.
"I traveled in April and I was completely caught off guard when Portland temperatures reached the 80s (20s in Celsius) on that trip," she recalls.
"Luckily, I packed a wardrobe designed with layering in mind, so I had lighter pieces that worked for the warmer temperatures. It was also quite cold and windy when I visited Chicago on that trip. So layering up was super important."
'Wonderful' weightlessness

Her light packing also made transportation a breeze.
"I felt like I had a lot more mental bandwidth on this trip when moving between destinations as I didn't have to worry about my luggage or think hard about what I was going to wear from my limited options.
"It's nice to be able to leave the airport or the train and head straight out with all your luggage and not feel weighed down in the process."
It also helped when it came time to check out of her room.
"On my last day in Vegas, I checked out of my accommodation and then proceeded to go shopping for the afternoon with all my luggage and belongings," she says.

"Since all I packed was my messenger bag, this was not uncomfortable or out of place. Also, not having to worry about getting back to my stored luggage before heading to the airport was wonderful."
Schoenman says it's more important than ever to travel light right now as airport operators struggle to maintain staffing levels post-pandemic.
"I just had someone share with me that they went on a trip and it took them eight weeks to get their bag back," she says. "Their bag went the completely opposite direction around the world to where they were going."
After receiving positive feedback from her blog post about her minimalist trip, she started teaching seminars about how others can do the same.
"People are very shocked that they were able to achieve what they were able to achieve," says Schoenman.
"I give them a framework, and then each week we focus on one area of packing. I give them lessons and assignments and step-by-steps."
Maximizing minimization
Schnoenman says minimal packing is partly down to a state of mind.

Graduates of the class have shared photos with her about their own minimalist travels. But at its core, she says, the class and the trip that inspired it aren't about what to pack or not to pack. It's a mindset.
"A lot of it is just realizing what are your priorities and being comfortable with less, which is really hard for some people to deal with.
"I've had people come out of the class and then they go and sign up for decluttering courses and stuff, because their mind is primed. They're like, what else can I minimize in my life?"
For those planning their own lightweight packing list for an upcoming trip, Schoenman says certain items are helpful, but not entirely necessary.

"Obviously, different sorts of packing cubes can be very helpful, especially anything that can compress things so that it's easier to get inside your small space.
"Another thing is just finding items that are the right size for your trip. Travel-sized toiletry containers are often way bigger than you need for your trip for many products that you're using."
These days, Schoenman doesn't travel with just a handbag on every trip, but she still keeps it light with backpacks of similar size, especially on frequent opal mining trips to the Australian outback.
"My max bag is a 26-liter bag," which is about the size of a school backpack. "Really. That's my high-end travel."
ritish Vogue's editor-in-chief Edward Enninful has addressed speculation that he's next in line to take the editorial seat at Vogue magazine currently occupied by Anna Wintour.
"Everybody focuses on American Vogue. Everybody wants to know what I'm doing, but I would like to tell you that I don't want Anna's job. I've spoken to her about it a few weeks ago," he said during an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour in London on Monday.
Rumors about Wintour's impending departure come and go as regularly as fashion weeks, but she and and Vogue's parent company Condé Nast continue to bat them away.
When pressed, Enninful said that if he was offered the job atop American Vogue's masthead he would say "not today." He also reiterated that Wintour has no plans to step down any time soon, revealing that they had spoken on the subject while at Paris Fashion Week in early October.
Since taking the helm at British Vogue in 2017, Enninful has been widely praised for bringing more diversity to the magazine's covers. He currently also serves as Condé Nast's European editorial director.
"I can really do better in the world than maybe I can on one magazine."

Enninful cut his teeth at youth culture title i-D magazine, where he was made fashion director at just 18 years of age. Enninful was awarded an OBE for his services to diversity in the fashion industry in 2016.
The Ghanaian-born editor, who immigrated to the UK in the 1980s, has been candid about his personal experiences with racism in the fashion industry over the years, including an incident of racial profiling which took place at Vogue headquarters in London in 2020, when he was asked by a security guard to enter the building via the loading bay, rather than the front door. "It just goes to show that sometimes it doesn't matter what you've achieved in the course of your life: The first thing that some people will judge you on is the colour of your skin," he said via his social media at the time.
Many of these experiences are detailed in Enninful's new memoir "A Visible Man," which he's been busy promoting in recent months while attending Spring-Summer 2023 fashion shows across New York, London, Milan and Paris.
Though Enninful made it clear American Vogue was not currently on the cards, there may still be change on the horizon.
He admitted that while touring his book around the world he realized he "can really do better in the world than maybe I can on one magazine."
When asked if he'd continue in his current roles, Enninful said "Well we're working on that right now, we're working it all out right now. But I know whatever I do will be very creative because that's my strength."(CNN) — Like Venice, Barcelona and Prague, Dubrovnik is a victim of its own success.
In 2019, more than three million tourists poured into the fabled walled town along Croatia's Dalmatian Coast and local authorities expect the number to reach that point again over the next few years as global tourism recovers from Covid-19.
Such were the pre-pandemic crowds and their impact on the historic city that UNESCO at one point threatened to revoke Dubrovnik's World Heritage status.
The rise in visitation was largely fueled by the launch of a new cruise ship terminal that could handle five ships at once and disembark as many as 10,000 passengers per day and an expanded international airport that could funnel those passengers to and from their boats.
As if that wasn't enough, along came a global hit television show that lured a whole new breed of tourist.
"Before 'Game of Thrones,' most of the people I guided were interested in art and architecture, that sort of thing," says veteran Dubrovnik guide Ivan Vukovic. "But then more and more people just wanted selfies at places where they made the show -- like Pile Gate and Fort Lovrijenac.
"And we had a big, big problem with naked Instagramers doing their own 'walk of shame' on the Jesuit Stairs."
That doesn't mean you shouldn't visit Dubrovnik -- it remains one of the coolest urban spaces on planet Earth. But for those who like their history, art and architecture with far fewer people, these seven alternative Croatian coastal towns deliver a similar vibe with far fewer people.
Ston
Just an hour's drive up the coast from Dubrovnik, Ston is one of Dalmatia's best-kept secrets. Founded by the ancient Illyrians, the laidback seaside village is renowned for its stone walls and incredible seafood.
Like a Croatian version of the Great Wall of China, the 14th-century battlements crawl up and over a mountain behind the village. It takes a few hours to trek Europe's longest fortified structure (3.5-miles/5.5-km), even less to run the ramparts during the annual Ston Walls Marathon.
A vehicle-free pedestrian street in Ston's old town is filled with outdoor cafes like Konoba Bakus that serve seafood specialties like Adriatic oysters, black cuttlefish risotto and mussels buzara. Feel free to linger all afternoon; the locals do.
Trogir
The town of Trogir feels more like Venice than any other Dalmatian Coast location.

Half an hour up the coast from Split, this tiny island city is like a miniature Dubrovnik, shaped by nearly four centuries of Venetian rule and thoroughly unspoiled. Surrounded by water, Trogir feels more like Venice than any other outpost along the Dalmatian Coast.
When Trogir was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997, the citation described the city as "an excellent example of a medieval town... that has conserved its urban fabric to an exceptional degree and with the minimum of modern interventions ... in every aspect of the townscape."
Even if you're not into quaint cobblestone streets and palm-lined waterfront promenades, the Cathedral of St. Lawrence -- with its iconic Venetian-style belltower and extravagant Radovan's Portal -- should put Trogir on your Dalmatian bucket list.

Primošten
Renowned for its summertime folk festival and donkey races, Primošten is almost another ancient island town. During the Renaissance, residents constructed a narrow causeway that connects their insular home to the mainland.
The town's narrow lanes harbor handicraft shops, one-off clothing boutiques and traditional konoba restaurants. Rising high above their red-tiled roofs, St. George's Church dominates a hilltop with awesome Adriatic views.
Across the causeway are sandy Mala Raduča and other beaches and a hinterland filled with vineyards that produce some of Croatia's finest wines.
Biograd na Moru
Sprawling across a small peninsula, Biograd boasts yet another medieval old town heavily influenced by centuries of Venetian rule. But its real strength is Adriatic access.
As one of the nautical hubs of the Dalmatian coast, Biograd offers numerous ways to get out on the water. Scuba and snorkel day trips depart daily for Kornati National Park and its myriad unspoiled islands.
Back in town, Marina Šangulin is homebase to several yacht charter firms offering a variety of motor- and canvas-powered vessels. You can also rent paddleboards and flit between the scenic coves south of the old town.

Lodged between a photogenic yacht-filled harbor and the island-spangled Adriatic, Zadar's old town offers a setting every bit as magical as Dubrovnik.
From a ruined Roman forum and Romanesque churches to its sturdy Venetian walls and an occasional communist-era structure that almost looks vintage, the old town's architecture is a mashup of the various people who have ruled Zadar over the years.
Alfred Hitchcock once remarked that Zadar had the most beautiful sunset he'd ever seen. And there is something special about the city at dusk as lights twinkle around the harbor, the waterfront sea organ plays a wave-generated tune, and the old town's cafes and bars spring to life.
Beyond its own attractions, Zadar is a great base for visiting medieval Nin (Croatia's first royal capital), bungee jumping off towering Maslenički Bridge, or hiking and rock climbing in Paklenica Gorge. And it's just a two-hour drive from the turquoise pools and copious waterfalls of Plitvice Lakes National Park.
Split
Encircled by factories and sprawling suburbs, Split isn't the most attractive Dalmatian destination. Yet Croatia's second largest city offers plenty to ponder.
The city's pride and joy is Diocletian's Palace, erected in the 4th century AD by a paranoid Roman emperor who was certain he would be assassinated if he didn't relocate from the imperial capital and surrounded himself by impregnable walls.
A UNESCO World Heritage Site all on its own, the palace is like a small city. Even today, more than 3,000 people live inside its massive outer walls. Don't miss the massive cellars, especially the gritty interface with portions that have yet to be excavated -- a cross section of residential trash deposited over 1,700 years.
Split's waterfront bustles with ferries bound for popular Adriatic islands like Brač, Hvar and outlandishly handsome Vis, where "Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again" was filmed on location (rather than real-life Greece).
Located in a park-like setting on the city's outskirts, the ancient Roman city of Salona preserves a large amphitheater, baths, basilica and many other structures. Looming on a nearby mountaintop is Klis Fortress, an imposing medieval castle once occupied by the Knights Templar and the mythical city of Meereen in Game of Thrones.

One of the northernmost cities of the Croatian coast, Pula lies along the western edge of the Istrian Peninsula not far from Venice. A star-shaped Renaissance castle crowns the old town. But Pula's claim to fame is Roman relics.
Nearly 2,000 years after it was built, Pula Arena remains one of the world's best-preserved Roman structures. Nowadays the colossal stadium provides a venue for plays, concerts and the annual outdoor Pula Film Festival.
Fast forwarding to the communist era, the intriguing Memo Museum Pula offers a stroll down memory lane to everyday life in Tito's Yugoslavia, of which Croatia was once a part. Pula is also the gateway to the islands of Brijuni National Park with its beaches, hiking trails, golf course and safari park.
Dubrovnik
If you can't resist the lure of Dubrovnik, a few things can make your visit easier.
While staying at a short-term rental or small hotel inside the city walls may seem like the ultimate in romance (and it is), this often involves schlepping your bags up hundreds of stone stairs. Meanwhile, those with rental cars will discover that the most convenient parking runs to around US$100 per day.
The alternative is staying just outside the walls at a rental or hotel (like the Hilton Imperial) that offers free parking. Or just don't have a vehicle; local bus services are fast, frequent and efficient, as are taxis and ride shares. At less than US$1 per kilometer, Uber rates to the old town run around US$8 from the cruise port and US$27 from the international airport.
Given the mild Mediterranean climate of the Dalmatian coast, you don't need many clothes. So keep your luggage to a minimum, especially if you're staying inside the walls.
Avoid the heaviest crowds by exploring the old town before and after the daily high tide of cruise ship passengers. Walking the polished limestone streets is especially pleasant at dawn or late evening.
Hire a guide for a walking tour. Not just for local history and architecture, but also for the lowdown on how Dubrovnik weathered the civil war that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s and what life is like today for those while still live inside the wallsBrisbane, Australia

 — 
When Australia’s richest woman Gina Rinehart threw a financial lifeline to Netball Australia, she triggered a debate about sponsorships and the role of social and political issues in the sporting sphere. Then she walked away.

Rinehart’s bombshell decision to withdraw a 14 million Australian dollar ($8.9 million) sponsorship deal for the Diamonds, Australia’s national netball team, caught the players off-guard and struck a blow to the future of Netball Australia – a sporting body mired in debt.

The drama engulfing the Diamonds is not new, but experts say disputes could become more common as athletes and fans take a stronger stance on the source of sponsorship money.

Last week, high-profile fans of the AFL’s Fremantle Dockers urged management to sever ties with long-term sponsor, fossil fuel company Woodside, over its carbon emissions.

Meanwhile, Australian test cricket captain Pat Cummins reportedly raised issues with Cricket Australia’s deal with Alinta Energy, for the same reasons.

For members of the Diamonds, the objections focused on racist comments made almost 40 years ago by Rinehart’s father, Lang Hancock, the founder of her company Hancock Prospecting.

Rinehart is a prolific supporter of Australian sports teams and typically earns praise for her sponsorship deals. Last year, Olympic swimmer Cate Campbell reportedly said that Rinehart had “saved swimming.”

But Kevin Argus, a lecturer in marketing from RMIT University, said Rinehart’s decision on Saturday to pull funding from Netball Australia was a “lost opportunity” to “embrace the national mood.”

“In Australia, we have witnessed many large powerful companies benefit enormously from positive associations with sport and withdraw their funding support as soon as an issue arises with athletes,” he told CNN Sport.

“The Diamonds athletes raised concerns about being seen to be supporting a legacy of Aboriginal discrimination. Some have expressed concerns about the environment.

“These are major issues today that won’t go away,” he said.

Infamous words come back to haunt players
At the center of the controversy is Noongar woman Donnell Wallam, a rising star who is set to make her debut this week as only the third Indigenous netball player to represent Australia.

Wallam had reportedly expressed reservations about wearing the Hancock logo due to comments Rinehart’s father made about Australia’s First Nations people.

During a televised interview in 1984, Hancock said he’d “dope the water up so they were sterile and breed themselves out.”

His words are a dark reminder of racist attitudes toward Indigenous people, and though Rinehart promotes her longstanding support of Aboriginal communities through mining royalties and charities, she has never publicly condemned her father’s statements.

Wallam’s teammates have rallied around her, and when the team ran onto the court to play New Zealand in the Constellation Cup last week, they wore their old uniforms, without the Hancock logo.

In the statement on Saturday, Rinehart and Hancock Prospecting said there was no requirement for the Diamonds to wear the logo during the New Zealand games and they did not refuse to wear it.

The statement said Hancock’s majority-owned mining company Roy Hill would also pull its support of Netball WA, a state netball body, as the two companies “do not wish to add to Netball’s disunity problems.”

Both Netball Australia and Netball WA would be offered four months of funding while they find new partners, the statement added.

Separately, Rinehart and Hancock seemed to take a swipe at the players by saying they consider it “unnecessary for sports organisations to be used as a vehicle for social or political causes.”

“There are more targeted and genuine ways to progress social or political causes without virtue signalling or for self-publicity,” the statement added.

On Monday, Kathryn Harby-Williams, CEO of the Australian Netball Players’ Association told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that Wallam had asked for an exemption not to wear the logo and was refused.

“In the end, unfortunately, Donnell found the pressure too much and decided that she would wear the logo.”

But it was too late.

Balancing social issues and funding
Netball Australia has made no secret of its financial difficulties. Despite being the most popular team sport in Australia with 1.2 million players, it made a loss last year of 4.4 million Australian dollars ($2.8 million).

Netball Australia CEO Kelly Ryan told Nine News the loss of Hancock sponsorship was “disappointing” but a “strong balance” needs to be struck between social issues and funding.

“There is a really important role that sporting organizations do play from grassroots right through to the elite to create a safe environment to have really strong social conversations,” Ryan said.

“But there also needs to be a balance in terms of the commercial realities of that as well.”

In a statement, the players said they were “disappointed” with Hancock’s decision to withdraw sponsorship and thanked other sponsors for their ongoing support.

The statement added: “Reports of a protest on behalf of the players, on environmental grounds, and a split within the playing group are incorrect. The singular issue of concern to the players was one of support for our only Indigenous team member.”

Vickie Saunders, founder of The Brand Builders, says Wallam’s objection to wearing the Hancock logo was deeply personal, and not a matter of a player using their public profile to promote a political cause.

“Her 60,000-year-old culture will tell you that it’s important. Her 200 years of survival, and her fellow Indigenous people will tell you it’s important,” Saunders said.

“She has a very personal reason for not wanting to wear a logo that represents a person who said that her people should be sterilized or bred out,” she said. “This isn’t a new issue for her. This is her life.”

Sponsoring Australian sport
Hancock Prospecting was founded in 1955 and retains interests in iron ore, coal, and mineral exploration, as well as beef and dairy.

The company also funds services for remote and rural Aboriginal communities, including health and education programs, and Rinehart is a familiar face in elite sporting circles.

The billionaire sponsors Swimming WA, Swimming Queensland, Volleyball Australia, Rowing Australia and Artistic Swimming Australia, and recently struck a deal to sponsor the Australian Olympic Team until 2026.

This week, in response to debate surrounding the Diamonds, many of those sporting bodies released statements lauding Rinehart’s dedication to sport.

“Mrs Rinehart’s selfless commitment to women’s sport deserves the accolades of our great sporting nation,” said Craig Carracher, president of Volleyball Australia. Swimming Queensland CEO Kevin Hasemann said he found “the negative characterization in some quarters of Mrs Rinehart’s new sponsorship of another sport regrettable.”

The Australian newspaper also weighed in with an editorial saying there was no room for “cancel culture” – “to sacrifice Mrs Rinehart because of comments made decades ago by her father, Lang Hancock, is a bridge too far.”

The Netball Australia sponsorship deal would have been worth 3.5 million Australian dollars ($2.2 million) per year for four years – an almost negligible amount for a company that posted a 7.3 billion Australian dollar ($4.6 billion) profit in 2021 on the back of soaring iron ore prices.

Kim Toffoletti, an associate professor of sociology at Melbourne’s Deakin University, said for less established sports, it can be difficult to say no to any offer of sponsorship.

“Their livelihoods are on the line … it’s very hard to turn that down that kind of money because that keeps your sport viable,” Toffoletti told CNN Sport.

“I don’t see it as a failure of the sport but maybe a system in which certain sports are economically and culturally rewarded over others, which means that there are many that do miss out.”

What players want
Today’s up and coming sports stars are members of Gen Z, born in the late 1990s to around 2010, whose attitudes may differ from the executives running established sporting bodies and big name brands.

Experts say sponsors can’t expect young athletes to align themselves with their values.

“Some of these sports have got very old-fashioned business models, which are built probably around 30-40 years ago in a different era,” Andrew Hughes, a marketing expert from the Australian National University, told CNN Sport.

“But now we put a lot of value on what brands stand for, what they represent. I think we see that reflected in how the athletes themselves think.”

Saunders, from The Brand Builders, said athletes are realizing that protecting their personal brand is more important than falling into line with the values of their sponsors.

“Your brand is actually your most valuable asset because after the game, or after your career, that’s the thing that you get to take with you into employment or other opportunities in life,” she said.

And that’s especially important for players who aren’t earning big money – like netballers – who need to find another source of income when their sports career is over, Saunders added.

Kevin Argus from RMIT University said Rinehart’s response to the debate – to cancel the contract – demonstrates “reactive decision making” that’s counterproductive for a company seeking to win public support.

He said a better option would have been to engage with the players, as a mentor would in a workplace, to better understand their values and how they can work together for the benefit of both parties.

“Exiting sponsorships when athletes behave as normal functioning human beings demonstrates reactive decision making and shines a light on the need for bolder, transformative leadership,” he said.

“When done well, sport sponsorship is brand transforming for both the sport and sponsor.”127 HOURS



PROLOGUE



You are going to die.

I hear the voice in my head. I call it my first voice.

It always comes after I've made some kind of mistake. Its words never help, they just make me feel bad. So I wait for the second voice. Its words are calm and sensible and nearly always help me. I wait, but tonight the second voice doesn't come. There is only silence, darkness and cold.

In the first days, the second voice always came. It stopped me feeling sad, angry, or afraid. It gave me ideas. It showed me things. It brought me hope. I believed I could be free again. But, slowly, that voice disappeared. My belief disappeared with it. Now there is only the first voice. It says the same thing over and over again. Finally, I must accept the truth: I am going to die.





CHAPTER ONE



'The most beautiful place on Earth'



It is Saturday, April the 26th, 2003. My name is Aron Ralston. I'm biking and hiking in Canyonlands National Park in southeast Utah, USA. Edward Abbey, one of my favourite writers, described it as 'the most beautiful place on Earth'. Right now, with the sun on my back and the wind in my hair, I agree.



Today is the third day of an activity holiday. It started on Thursday when I went climbing and skiing on Mount Soplis with my friend, Brad. Yesterday, I biked the Slick Rock Trail, alone. It's not very long - only a little over nineteen kilometres - but it's one of the most difficult bike trails in the US. Today, my plan is to hike through Blue John and Horseshoe Canyons after biking to the trail. I'll leave my bike at the end of the trail and hike back to the carpark. I'll drive over in the truck and collect the bike later.



After that, I'll drive to Goblin Valley, about eighty kilometres north of here. My friends are having a party there. I hope I get some sleep because tomorrow I want to hike the most popular trail in southern Utah - Little White Horse.



I plan to spend the whole of Monday biking along the White Rim Trail. The trail forms a rough circle of 175 kilometres. It's not difficult and I should be able to finish in about eighteen hours. By Monday evening, I'll be back in Aspen, Colorado. Aspen is famous for its mountains and the countryside around it. It's a popular place for skiing. I live there and I work for Ute Mountaineer, a sports equipment shop. Leona, one of the people I live and work with, is having a goodbye party on Monday night. Now that winter is over, she's going to another town in Colorado to work as a gardener for the summer. Her party will be a cool way to end my trip.





00 hrs

8.45 am I arrive at the Horseshoe Canyon carpark early in the morning, pull my bike from the truck and lock the door. Then I check the time: eight forty-five in the morning. As I start cycling, I wonder how quickly I can get to the start of the trail.

I can now see the sign pointing to this end of the trail.

That means I've cycled thirteen kilometres in less than two hours. That's good. It will give me more time to finish my hike back to the truck. I lock my bike to a tree and start walking.



As I walk, I think about the history of the people who were here before me. One of them, Butch Cassidy, was very famous. He and his men stole horses and hid from the law during the last years of the nineteenth century.



Since that time, the area has been called Robbers Roost country.

My climbing bag is heavy with the weight of my equipment. I think about my plan for the day. Blue John Canyon will be the most difficult part of the hike.

Three kilometres along the trail is the Big Drop Rappel.

Here, the canyon suddenly drops eighteen metres. The hardest part is 180 metres before this. The walls there are very narrow and the trail goes up and down, sharply. There are also a lot of very large rocks called boulders, stuck between the canyon walls. If these boulders move or fall, they can be dangerous.

But I'm not thinking of danger at the moment. I am excited. Today, I will finally see the Great Gallery. The Gallery is part of Horseshoe Canyon, and it's famous for the huge rock paintings which cover its walls. Some of them are more than five thousand years old. I should reach my truck by late afternoon. So far, things are going well. I arrived here earlier than I thought. This gives me a little more time to finish my trip.

I always get very excited when I'm about to leave on a trip. This means I sometimes forget things. Before starting this trip, I forgot to leave a message telling anyone exactly where I was going. This is one of the things my mother taught me. But this time, I just called a quick goodbye to my housemates - Brian, Joe, and Leona. Leona asked where I was going. I told her I was going to Utah and promised to be back for her party. Then I got in my truck and drove away.



I can't wait for adventure. It makes me feel happier than anything. It's part of who I am.



I'm on a high rock, looking down at the trail. I've stopped because I can hear voices. This surprises me. I had expected to be alone. Two young women suddenly appear below me. I feel pleased. I've spent the last eighteen hours alone. It will be good to have company for a while.

'Hi,' I call as I climb down the rock. The girls hadn't noticed me. They turn, looking a little nervous. I guess they are about twenty-five years old.

I smile and hold out my hand, 'My name's Aron.'

They smile back. 'I'm Megan,' says the darker girl, 'and this is Kristi.'



We shake hands and continue along the trail. As we go, we talk about our interests. We all love hiking, biking and adventures. For all of us, this is more important than earning a lot of money. They work in the same business, too. They work for Outward Bound, a sports equipment shop in Moab, Utah. Both Aspen and Moab are important tourist centres for hikers.



We are on the trail together for about five kilometres. At that point, there is a smaller canyon to the west. The west canyon goes back in a half-circle. The girls left their bikes at the end of it. We will say goodbye there and I'll continue on alone to the Big Drop Rappel.

We arrive just before 2.00 pm. I don't feel like saying goodbye. In the hour and a half we've been together, we've already become friends.

Megan feels the same. 'Why don't you come with us?' she asks. 'We can finish the west canyon trail, go back to our truck and have a few beers.'

I like the idea, but following my plan is more important. I ask them to come with me.

'How far is it back to your truck?' Megan asks.

'Around thirteen kilometres.'

'That's too far. You won't get back before dark,' she says.

'Maybe not, but I really want to do the Big Drop Rappel. And I can't miss the paintings in the Great Gallery. I'll meet you after for a drink.'

We agree on a plan to meet and go to the party together.



Then I turn and wave goodbye. The movement is so easy I don't think about it. But there is something I don't know. It is the last time I will wave goodbye with my right hand.





CHAPTER TWO



The accident



The girls disappear into the west canyon. I am alone again. I continue walking towards the Big Drop Rappel. It seems strangely quiet without Kristi and Megan. I turn on my CD player and listen to a soft, slow song by Phish, one of my favourite bands.



The music is perfect for the way I feel: lucky, free and happy. The weather is perfect, too. It's warm and sunny with just a few white clouds in the sky.

Suddenly, my feet hit a pile of loose stones and I nearly fall to the ground.

Careful, Aron.

I listen to the voice in my head and look up the canyon. I can see that the trail ahead becomes more difficult. The Big Drop Rappel is now just under a kilometre away.



Twenty minutes later, I arrive at the most difficult part of the trail. Here, the canyon walls are a lot narrower. The trail rises and falls and is full of sharp rocks. I will have to be careful. I look up and see part of a tree stuck between the canyon walls. It was carried along the canyon after heavy rain. This is one of the dangers of hiking in canyon country. After a sudden storm, canyons can quickly fill with water. In seconds, the water can throw you against the canyon walls and kill you. That's why it's always very important to check the weather before canyoning.



Just below the tree is the first drop in the trail. It's only about three metres, so I won't need any equipment. There are plenty of holes in the rock for my hands and feet so I climb down easily. A metre from the bottom I let go and land on the ground. Soft sand covers the tops of my boots. From here, it would be difficult to climb back up. One thing is immediately clear: I can't go back.

The canyon walls become even narrower. Stuck between them, as far as I can see, are boulders of different sizes. It's an unusual sight. I stop and take a few pictures with my camera.



The Big Drop Rappel is now only about 160 metres away. Climbing down will be no problem. I have all the equipment I need in my backpack. For food, I have two burritos. I also have a full water bottle and an extra two litres in a CamelBak.

The boulders are both good and bad news. The good news is that I should be able to climb over many of them. This will be quicker than dropping on to the trail and climbing back up again. The bad news is that the boulders could move. I will have to be careful.



I manage the first few boulders without any problems and reach another drop. This one is about four metres down. About three metres from the edge of the drop is a boulder. It's about the same size as the wheel of a bus. If I climb onto it, the drop from there will be shorter. I chimney to the boulder quite easily.



As I stand on it, I feel something move. The movement stops almost immediately. It seems there's nothing to worry about. I lie down, put my hands in two holes on the far edge of the boulder and push my legs over the opposite side to jump down.



As most of my weight pushes on one side of the boulder, it makes a strange sound. Immediately I know this is trouble but it's too late to go back. From this point, everything seems to happen very slowly. I let go of the boulder and drop towards the ground. As I fall, I look up and see the boulder crashing towards my head. If I don't get out of the way, I'm dead. I try to push against the boulder with both hands. It hits my left hand hard against the canyon wall. I pull it back with a scream of pain. The boulder then hits my right arm and traps my hand against the right side of the canyon.





6 hrs

2.45 pm All this happens in a couple of seconds. I don't even notice landing on the canyon floor. I am so shocked I feel no pain. I just stand there, looking at my trapped hand in disbelief.

Stupid, Aron, stupid! When you first stood on the rock, it moved. That was a clear message to stay away! But you were in such a hurry to finish the hike you didn't stop and check.

The voice in my head doesn't help. It just makes things worse.

A terrible pain travels up my arm. I scream and pull hard to try and free myself. Nothing happens. I try again. This time I push against the boulder with my knees at the same time.

It's no good. The boulder is a lot heavier than I am.



I am stuck and there's no way out.





CHAPTER THREE



Three plans



Stop thinking about how bad the problem is, Aron. You need to be sensible.

The voice in my head is right. I must be sensible. This has to be my rule from now on.

The first thing I need is a drink. Without stopping to think, I take the water bottle from my bag and drink a third of it in five seconds.

I suddenly realise what I'm doing and pull the bottle out of my mouth. Already, I have broken my rule to be sensible.

I have no idea how long I will be here. This means that the most important thing of all is to save water.



Damn it, Aron! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!





6 hrs 43 mins

3.28 pm It's almost forty-five minutes since my accident. I am calmer than before. For the last half hour, I've been thinking of my best chance of escape. I said I would meet Kristi and Megan after the hike. If I don't appear, will they go to my truck to find me? I won't be there. But will they realise that something is wrong and go for help?



The answer is probably 'no'. Kristi and Megan don't know me very well. They'll just think that I decided not to meet them. What about other hikers? Will they find me by chance? Again, the answer is probably 'no'. Very few people travel to the Great Gallery from this end of the trail. My friends won't worry, either. They weren't completely sure I was going to the party. Even on Monday evening, my housemates will just think I'm late getting back. No one will miss me until Tuesday morning. When I don't arrive for work, Brion After, my boss, will know that something is wrong. I am never late for work. He will probably call my family and they will tell the police that I am missing. But I didn't tell anyone exactly where I was going, so it will take the police days to find me. If I don't escape before then, I will die.



All of this means that I will have to get out of here alone. But how?

I can think of three possible plans. The first plan is to use the large knife on the multi-tool to chip at the boulder. This might take away enough of the rock to free my hand. The second plan is to try and lift the boulder using some of my equipment. The third plan is the worst. I could amputate my arm using the multi-tool. It's too soon to think of that idea.

I try plan one. I take the multi-tool from my climbing bag. It has two knives. One is longer than the other. I use the longest one, which is not so sharp. To free my hand, I must remove a piece of rock over fifteen centimetres wide and seven centimetres deep. That's a lot of rock.



10 hrs 15 mins



7.0 pm I've been chipping at the rock for almost three and a half hours. I stop for a drink of water. I lay the multi-tool on the boulder and reach for the water bottle. This time I am more careful and take only a sip. I wonder how long I'll be able to survive with the water I have left, only two-thirds of a litre. Until Monday night, maybe? Tuesday morning at the latest.





CHAPTER FOUR



Night and day



After Kristi and Megan left Aron, they got lost in the west canyon and arrived late at the meeting place. He wasn't there.

'He's probably left already,' said Megan, 'but he can't be far away. Let's drive around and see if we can find him.'

But there was no sign of Aron or his bike. 'It doesn't really matter,' said Megan. 'We'll see him at the party.'

Again, she was wrong. By the time they reached Goblin Valley, the car park was full and there was nowhere to stay for the night.

The girls now felt very tired and decided not to go to the party. 'We'll drive to Little Wild Horse Canyon tomorrow morning,' said Megan. 'We'll probably find Aron there.'

Kristi agreed and they parked by the side of the road for the night.

The next morning, there was no sign of Aron at Little Wild Horse Canyon. All they found was a truck from Colorado with a bike inside and skis on the roof.

'That's probably Aron's truck,' said Megan. 'He must be in the canyon already. We've missed him again.'

She wrote their email addresses on a piece of paper and left it on the truck window.

'Why didn't we just get his phone number?' Megan asked as they drove back to Moab.



15 hrs 15 mins



12.00 am My headlamp is on and I'm chipping at the boulder. I've managed to chip a space above and below an area of pink rock. Perhaps I can remove this large piece before I stop for the night. I will need to hit it hard. I don't want to break the knife, so I use a different part of the multi-tool. I hit the boulder as hard as I can and the piece of rock falls onto my trapped arm. I can now see some softer rock below. I chip at the rock for another hour and remove as much as the piece that came off before. More success, but my left arm hurts and I have to stop.



I take a sip of water. I have decided to do this every ninety minutes. I look up at the sky. It's a clear night and it's very cold.



Now that I've stopped chipping I feel cold. The wind is the worst. Every few minutes, it blows down the canyon and makes my body shake. I decide to use my climbing bag as a jacket to keep warm. I lay everything inside it on top of the boulder. Then I put the bag back on. I'm a little warmer but I need something soft to put my legs on. I take my rope, form it into a circle, and lay it on a rock below me. Now I can rest my knees instead of standing up all the time.



After a while, I begin to feel uncomfortable again. The problem is the weight on my legs. I decide to try and build some kind of seat. I put on my harness and rope. Then I tie carabiners to one end of the rope and make a kind of ball. The idea is to throw the rope over one of the boulders above my head. If I do it right, the ball will stick in the space between the boulder and the canyon wall.

It takes twenty-five throws before it lands in the right place. Now, will it hold my weight? I sit in the harness. It holds. Success! I feel very happy. But I'm not comfortable for long. I soon need to move again. I stand and chip for twenty minutes, then sit and rest for twenty minutes. This becomes my routine.

As morning comes, I'm not feeling too unhappy. This first night was not as bad as I thought. I've done quite well, but one thought still worries me: I haven't chipped much rock from the boulder. At this speed, it will take me 150 hours to free my trapped arm.



Chipping is not enough. I will have to think of something else.





CHAPTER FIVE



A sad message



23 hrs 30 mins

8.15 am I am feeling optimistic. The sun is shining into the canyon and a raven has just flown across the blue sky above my head. The sight and sound of the bird fills me with hope.

I hold my leg in the sunlight. It feels warm against my skin. But I need to do something. It's time for plan two. I will use my ropes, webbing and carabiners to try and lift the boulder and free my hand. I look up. There's a sharp piece of rock above my head. If I can throw the rope around this, it might hold everything in the right position.

After many tries, I finally succeed. I tie the other end of the rope around the boulder. But when I pull, nothing happens. Everything holds, but the boulder doesn't move. I put more weight on the rope, but it still doesn't work. The rope is not tight enough.



28 hrs 15 mins

1.00 pm I've spent four hours trying to lift the boulder, but nothing has worked.

Suddenly, I hear voices.

'Help! Help!' I shout.

I stop and listen. At first, there's nothing. But then I hear a sound from above and realise my mistake. It's just a small animal moving in the rock. I'd imagined it was people.

The sound of my voice shouting for help frightened me.



It made me feel lost and alone. I make a promise that I won't do it again. The optimistic feelings of earlier in the day have disappeared. No one is going to save me. That leaves only the third, and worst, plan: I will have to amputate my right arm. What will I need for the job? The knife, that's certain, but also a tourniquet to stop the blood. The plastic pipe from the CamelBak seems best for that. I take it off and use a carabiner to make it tight. It works well and I feel a bit better.



As soon as I put the knife against the skin of my arm, I feel ill. I can't do it. It would be like killing myself. I drop the knife and lay my head on the boulder. None of my plans have worked. I can't free my hand. I can't lift the boulder. I can't amputate my arm. My only hope is rescue, but I'll die before help arrives.

I feel angry with the boulder, but it's not the boulder's fault - it's mine. Everything about this stupid adventure was a mistake. I didn't tell anyone where I was going, I didn't go with Kristi and Megan to the west canyon, and I didn't get off the boulder when it moved.



30 hrs

2.45 pm It's exactly twenty-four hours since the accident.

I decide it's time to film a message for my family and friends. I place my camcorder on the boulder, turn it on and start speaking.

'My name is Aron Ralston. It's just after three o'clock on Sunday, April the 27th, 2003. I have been trapped in Blue John Canyon for the last twenty-four hours. My parents are Donna and Larry Ralston of Eaglewood, Colorado. If anyone finds this, please give it to them. Thank you.'

I describe all that has happened in the last two days. As I reach the end of my story, I feel very sad. I know this could be a final goodbye to my parents and sister, Sonja.

After telling them how much I love them, there is only one more thing to say. 'Mum, Dad, Sonja - I'm sorry.'



I turn off the machine. All I can do now is wait for someone to find me.





CHAPTER SIX



Waiting



33 hrs 15 mins

6.00 pm My second night in the canyon is moving closer. Beyond that, I see no future. Escape has been impossible and I will die before anyone finds me. I feel strong enough to survive the fear of death, but not my body's need for water. This terrible, growing thirst will drive me crazy.

I now have only a quarter of a litre of water left. I have to make this last as long as possible. I drank at 3.15 pm, just after I finished filming. Then I missed the next drink and decided to save it for later. I'll drink at nine, midnight, three and six in the morning, but I'll take even smaller sips.



The mosquitoes have found me. There are several at my feet and some drinking the blood on the canyon wall. I kill five or six as they circle around my head. Can I eat them, I wonder? Even if I could, it wouldn't be enough to keep me alive.

I go back to waiting. It seems colder than the night before. I start chipping at the boulder just to keep warm.





36 hrs 15 mins

9.00 pm Night has fallen. The mosquitoes have gone. The sky above is beautiful: clear with bright stars. But clear skies mean lower temperatures. I must do something to cover more of my body.

I tie the camera bag around my left arm. Then I tie webbing around my right arm and put rope around each of my legs. I do the same for my right arm, using webbing.

I put rope round each leg. It looks funny and I can't help smiling.

I begin my routine of standing and sitting. Most of my body feels warmer, but I'm still shaking because my head and neck are cold. I decide to put the plastic rope bag over my head. I keep the far end open to let fresh air in. I lay my head against the boulder. I still can't sleep but at least I'm warmer.

The long, boring hours of the night pass slowly by. Finally, the sky grows lighter. Today, it's a dirty white colour. I wonder if this is cloud. Clouds at night are good because they trap the day's heat in the canyon, but clouds during the day are bad because the sun doesn't warm the air. There's also the chance of a storm.

Slowly the pale sky turns bright blue. It's going to be hot again. As always, the light and warm air make me want to do something. I try and lift the boulder again by pushing down on the rope with my feet.

This doesn't work either and I feel suddenly hopeless. What more can I do? No voice inside my head suggests anything useful. All I see in my mind are pictures of the food and drink left on the floor of my truck.



I think again about amputating my arm. I didn't try hard enough the last time. I need to be brave and try again.



I put on the tourniquet and make it tight. When everything is ready, I try to cut through the skin of my arm with the longer knife. I push hard but the skin doesn't break. Then, over the same area, I use the shorter, sharper knife. But even that doesn't work. It's still not sharp enough to do the job.



All I have for the time I've spent on this is a long red line across my right arm. I take off the tourniquet and go back to waiting.





47 hrs 30 mins

8.15 am The raven appears. I check my watch. It has arrived at exactly the same time as yesterday.

For the first time in two days, I need to urinate. I open my shorts and watch the yellow urine disappear into the sand.

I spend most of the day chipping, resting, and counting the minutes before my next drink of water.



54 hrs

2.45 pm It's the middle of the afternoon and time to film again. Filming has now become a part of my daily routine. I turn on the camcorder.

'Hi, everyone. It's Monday, April the 28th. I'm still trapped. I've been here for exactly forty-eight hours. That's two whole days with no sleep and very little water. I now have only about one-eighth of a litre left.'

I continue with a message to my sister, Sonja. She is getting married in the autumn. I tell her how proud I am of her and send her my love and best wishes.

I finish filming at 3.35 pm. It's strange but I feel the need to urinate again. This time, my second voice tells me not to urinate on the ground.



Save it, Aron. It will soon be all you have to drink.



It's good advice. I urinate into the CamelBak. The urine is now a dark orange colour. The other urine was clearer. Why didn't I save it?



57 hrs 15 mins

6.00 pm It's early evening. Sunlight shines off the bottom of thin clouds high above me. I hope they will stay and keep the heat in the canyon. But as time passes, it seems to grow colder. My water won't last much longer. Soon, I will have to start drinking urine.

Like the raven, the mosquitoes seem to arrive on time. I kill a few more. Mosquitoes mean there must be water quite close - probably at the Big Drop Rappel.

Forget it, Aron. You'll never see water again.



The first voice is back. I try not to listen.



CHAPTER SEVEN



'Where's Aron?'



Back in Aspen, Aron's housemates were preparing for the party. Elliot, another friend of his, was moving into the house after Leona had gone. At eight-thirty, he asked, 'Has anyone seen Aron?'

'No,' said Brian. 'He's probably still on his trip.'

'Does he know about the party?' Elliot asked.

'Of course,' said Leona. 'He said he'd be here for sure.

He'd better come. It's my goodbye party. I'll be upset if he doesn't come.'

The party ended at around two o'clock the next morning, but there was still no sign of Aron.

The first person to think something might be wrong was Aron's boss, Brion. Early Tuesday morning, he called the house and spoke to Leona.

'He didn't come to the party last night,' Leona told him. 'I thought he'd driven straight to work.'

'No, he's not here, and Aron's never late. I think something might be wrong. Could you call me right away if he gets back?'

'Yes, sure,' said Leona, feeling a little worried.

She called Brion later that afternoon to ask if Aron had arrived.

'No,' said Brion. 'Did he say where he was going?'

'He didn't say much to any of us. Only that he was going climbing and biking. He also said he might hike in Utah. Somewhere in Canyonlands. He didn't say where, exactly.'



'Mmm, that's a big area,' said Brion. 'I'll wait until nine o'clock tomorrow morning. If he's not back by then, I'll call his parents.'



Aron's housemates decided not to wait any longer. At six-thirty that evening, they called the police. The officer on the desk asked for Aron's information: full name, age, height and weight. He also wanted to know the model of his truck and the license-plate number. But there was something the officer didn't tell them: a person has to be missing for at least forty-eight hours before the police will start a search and rescue operation. This meant that they wouldn't do anything until late the following day.



63 Mrs 15 mins

12.00 am It's my third night here and I've decided to take my first sip of urine. There's still half a cup of water left, but I want to save it.



The urine tastes bad, but not quite as bad as I thought. I decide not to drink any more until the water is finished. I've changed my drinking routine because the night is colder. I can now only sit for a few minutes so I take smaller sips every hour.





66 hrs 15 mins

3.00 am It's now sixty hours since my accident. That's sixty hours of pain, no sleep, and very little water.

Two hours later, it's time for my next sip of water. I put the bottle between my legs and turn the top. When it's open, I try and lift it towards my mouth. But it hits my harness and falls back onto my legs. I am too tired to catch it. Some of the valuable water falls onto my shorts.

'Damn! Damn! Damn!' I shout.

Now look what you've done! Says the first voice.

I know exactly what I've done. I've just lost half of the rest of my life.



70 hrs

6.45 am As morning arrives once more, I feel a little hope. At least I've survived another night. It's now Tuesday, April the 29th: my fourth day trapped in the canyon.

I decide to film earlier today. I put the camcorder on the boulder, then turn the screen the other way. I don't want to look at myself as I speak.



'Hi. It's Tuesday morning. I guess everyone missed me when I didn't arrive for Leona's party last night. Most people will probably think I'm still travelling. Except for Brion. When I don't arrive for work, he'll think something is wrong. He might call the police and report me missing. They'll wait forty-eight hours before searching. If I'm lucky, they'll start some time on Wednesday. If I'm very lucky, they might search the Robbers Roost area first. Even then, the earliest they'll reach me is Thursday. I'll try to stay alive as long as I can, but I can't imagine living longer than one more day. This means help will arrive too late. By Thursday, I'll be dead. And this video will be history.'





CHAPTER EIGHT



The raven



70 hrs 45 mins



7.30 am That last video recording was the most pessimistic so far. It's strange, but the feeling of hopelessness doesn't last. As the sky grows brighter, I think of the raven. The bird is a sign of hope. Just thinking about it makes me want to do something.

I try lifting the boulder once more. I make the rope even shorter, but when I step on it, nothing happens. I do everything I can to make it work. I push, jump and shout as I put all my weight onto the rope. It's still no good. The boulder doesn't move a millimetre.

I step down and lay my head on the boulder. I feel like crying but I can't. There's not enough water in my body to produce any tears. But there's still the knife. It's lying open on top of the boulder.

Suddenly, I know what I'm going to do. Quickly, I put the tourniquet around my arm and tighten it. Then I pick up the multi-tool, open the shorter knife and push it hard into my arm. This time, the knife goes all the way in.



I pull out the knife and look at the deep hole I've made in my right arm. I can't believe I've done this. It didn't even hurt and there's very little blood. I can see the bones in my arm through the hole. I will never be able to cut through them with only a small knife.



It's time for a drink. I pick up the bottle and feel the last of the water disappear down my throat. I check the time. It's exactly 8.00 am and all I have to drink now is urine.



71 hrs 45 mins

8.30 am The raven appears. It's fifteen minutes late but I'm happy. I was beginning to think it wouldn't come. I feel happy and start thinking of all the wonderful times I've spent with friends and family. I remember a trip to Washington D.C. with my sister, and another to Gettysburg with my dad. I also think of all the adventures I've had with different friends. The time passes quickly Midday arrives without me realising.

I urinate into the CamelBak. Then I pour the clearer half of the urine into my water bottle. I throw the rest away. I have no idea how long anyone can survive on urine alone. At least drinking it wasn't as bad as I expected.

It is now the warmest part of the day. This is the time I am most comfortable. I have found the best way to sit and feel calmer in the warm air. Perhaps help will arrive in time. If so, I will soon be as free as the raven.

Three hours later, I have reached the end of my third day trapped in the canyon. None of my plans of escape have worked. All I can do is stay strong for another night and hope for rescue.



I eat the last burrito. It is too dry to get down my throat so I take a mouthful of urine. The urine tastes better at night because it's colder, but it's still going to be a long, hard night. On Wednesday morning, Brion After was at work in the shop. At nine-fifteen, he called Leona to check if he had arrived, but he hadn't. Brion had waited long enough.



He picked up the phone. Aron's mother answered on the first ring.

'Mrs Ralston?'

'Yes?'

'This is Brion After - Aron's boss at Ute Mountaineer. I'm afraid I'm rather worried about him. He hasn't returned from a trip he took last week. Do you know where he went? No one here has seen him since last Wednesday.'

'Oh dear,' said Aron's mother. 'I have no idea where he is.

I called him last week and left a message, but he didn't call back. Did he tell any of his housemates where he was going?'

'No, just that he might hike somewhere in the Canyonlands area of Utah,' explained Brion

'I think you should call the Aspen police.'

'Yes, I'll do that right now. I'll let you know what happens.'

'Thank you, Brion.'

Mrs Ralston's hand was shaking as she put down the phone. She suddenly had an idea. Perhaps Aron had sent an email to one of his friends saying where he was going?

She went to the computer. Aron had an email address - but what was it? She found his name, but had to answer a secret question to read his emails. None of the answers she gave worked but she kept trying. In the end, she guessed the correct answer and sent the information to Brion.

After Brion had called the Aspen police, the head officer, Adam Crider, started the rescue operation. He called Mrs Ralston for the license-plate number of her son's truck. Mrs Ralston had written it down on a piece of paper. When she read it to Officer Crider, she didn't realise it was wrong. Aron had given it to her in a hurry and made a mistake.



Officer Crider called back and told Mrs Ralston there was no record of that license plate. This left her with another problem. How could she find the correct license-plate number?



Brion After was having better luck. He had found a list of email addresses for Aron's climbing friends. Perhaps they knew where he was. He wanted to check immediately, but he had to leave for Australia that day. He called Aron's housemate Elliot and asked him to manage the store and rescue operation until he returned. Elliot agreed.

When Elliot reached the store, he received a call from Mrs Ralston. She wanted to check the license-plate number she had given Brion. It was on his desk. Elliot checked as she read out the number.

'Wait. Did you say 886, Mrs Ralston?'

'Yes.'

'Brion made a mistake. He wrote down 888. I'll call Officer Crider and give him the correct number.'

By early afternoon, Elliot had received an email from Steve Pratchett, the most important of Aron's climbing friends. Steve had climbed for many years. He often led rescue operations to find climbers lost in the mountains. Another friend, Jason, had sent Steve a list of all the canyons Aron said he wanted to hike in Canyonlands. Steve called the Utah police for the area and spoke to one the main officers, Kyle Ekker. Officer Ekker was very helpful. Steve gave him the latest license-plate number for Aron's truck and Officer Ekker sent his men out to look for it.

They returned as night fell. There was no sign of the truck. Officer Ekker checked the number with the national license office. There was no vehicle on record. Once again, the number was wrong.



The bad news reached Aron's mother. Then she remembered that Aron was living in Albuquerque, New Mexico, when he bought the truck. The vehicle license office for the area was in Santa Fe. She called and an officer searched the records and found Aron's name. The records showed his license-plate number as NM 846-MMY.



Finally, they had the correct number. The information was given to Officer Ekker. It was too late to continue searching that night. It would have to wait until the morning.



'Wait for us, Aron,' Mrs Ralston said as she went to bed. 'We're coming.'





89 hrs 15 mins



2.00 am The darkness seems unreal. In fact, I don't know what is real and what isn't anymore. I start to have visions. Friends suddenly appear in the canyon like silent ghosts and wave me towards them. I follow and find myself in some place I know from the past. They smile at me in a kind way, but they never speak. Because of their kindness, I am not afraid. I know they are protecting me. I am happy while the visions last. To me, they are real. It is only when they disappear and the cold and pain return that I know they are not. Then, shaking hard, I continue chipping at the boulder. After that, I sit again and it's not long before the visions return. During the second half of the night, I have visions of myself as a child. Sometimes I'm playing cards with my grandfather. Other times I am running across bright green fields with my friends.



Something about the visions tells me that I have not given the people I care about enough attention. I'm always thinking of the things I want to achieve and not noticing other people. Now I realise that my love for friends and family is the main reason I want to escape. The thought of seeing them again is keeping me alive. I promise myself that if I can escape from here back to the people, I will be kinder towards them.

The visions always include some kind of drink. It is usually something cold and sweet like apple juice or ice tea. Just as I am about to drink, the vision disappears and I wake up. Then I feel the cold and the pain of the rope against my legs. I stand up and begin my routine all over again.



However, the visions tell me something: I am not ready to die. As morning comes on the fifth day, I feel sure I can still last a few more days. I don't know if this is true, but I'm still alive when the sun rises. The raven appears on time. The sound of its wings and the light in the canyon are beautiful. I watch its smooth flight, following the line of the canyon. I take out my camera and film as it disappears from view.





CHAPTER NINE



'It's his truck'



97 hrs 45 mins

10.30 am I don't want to look at my watch. When I did this last night, the time seemed to pass more slowly. I have a new idea. It came to me, as I was looking at all the rocks around me. Why not find a hard rock and use it to break the boulder? There's one in a hole in the canyon wall above me. It is round and black. I reach up and pull it out. It's perfect - just the right size and weight.

I hit the rock hard against the boulder. Little bits of stone fly into the air. It's working. I continue, but soon have to stop because of the pain in my left hand. I decide to rest for a while.

Early afternoon is usually the warmest time of day. But today it's only thirteen degrees, the coldest day so far. It also means that tonight will be the coldest night. Realising this makes me want to do something while it's still light.

The problem with using the black rock was that it hurt my left hand. But what if I tie a sock around my hand to protect it? I do this and it works. By 6.00 pm, I have taken off more of the boulder in three hours than I did in four days. But it's still not enough. And even with the sock there is too much pain in my left hand to continue.

I put down the rock. I feel sure I won't survive another night in the canyon. I finally accept this. There is nothing else I can do to save myself.



110 hrs 15 mins



11.00 pm The canyon feels as cold as ice. I have been awake for over a hundred hours. Another night of the sitting - standing routine will kill me. I haven't had any clean water since eight o'clock yesterday morning, only urine. How much longer can I survive? Death could come at any moment. I am so certain of this that I take the knife and write the dates of my life on the canyon wall. When I have finished I read them by the light of my headlamp: ARON OCT 75 - APR 03.



Around midnight, I have another vision. I am walking alone through the canyon wall. On the other side is a living room. I step inside and look around. A little boy in a red shirt comes into the room. I guess he must be about three. Suddenly, I know who he is. He is my future son and the room is in my future home. The little boy runs across the wooden floor, laughing. I pick him up with my left arm. My right arm has no hand. Then I put him onto my shoulder and he laughs even more. He holds my arms in his little hands and together we dance around the room. The sun is shining and I feel free, happy, and alive.



The vision disappears. I am back in the canyon again, but now I don't feel the same as before. Seeing the boy has changed everything. Now, even with the cold, pain, tiredness and thirst, I am sure I will survive.



On Thursday, May the 1st, Kyle Ekker was looking at a map of the Canyonlands area on his office wall. The clock above read 9.07 am. Already that morning, his men had searched the top and centre of the area and found nothing.

What about the Robbers Roost canyons in the south? The only roads down there were made of rocks and sand. It might take longer to search. He called Glen Sherrill, the head officer for the area. When Glen answered the phone, Kyle described Aron's truck.

'It's a red Toyota. License number NM 846-MMY.'



'I think I've seen a truck like that,' Glen replied. 'I'll radio one of my men and ask them to check.'



Kyle thanked him and put down the phone.

Twenty minutes later, Glen called back. 'Officer Kyle?'

'Speaking.'

'Glen Sherrill here. We've found the truck you're looking for. It's in the Horseshoe Canyon carpark.'



By 10.00 am, the good news had reached Elliot, Steve, and Mrs Ralston. Steve immediately arranged for a rescue team to join the police and help in the search. Half an hour later, they were on their way. Things were now moving fast.





CHAPTER TEN



Escape



120 hrs

8.45 am It's Thursday, May the 1st. 120 hours without sleep. Two days without water. I can't believe I'm still alive. I didn't think I'd survive beyond Wednesday. Perhaps the vision of the little boy kept me alive last night. But now, with no sign of a rescue, my hopes are disappearing fast.

I am also upset because the raven hasn't appeared. It's never been this late before. I try and forget about the bird and pick up the camcorder. I am certain that this will be my last message to my family.

I am calm as I leave necessary instructions for my parents.

I tell them to give most of my things to Sonja. Then I tell them what to do with my dead body. The video ends with three simple words: 'I love you.'

I'm crying as I close the camcorder for the last time. But there are no tears - my body is too dry for tears.

Now I can only wait. I can't accept this. I've discovered that nothing I can do will help me escape. But it's better to be doing something than nothing. I pick up the black rock and hit it as hard as I can against the boulder. I continue, trying to forget the pain in my left hand. In the end, I can't. I try to drop the rock, but the fingers of my hand won't open.

What have you done now? asks the first voice.

Stay calm, says the second.

Slowly, my fingers loosen and the stone falls out of my hand. I look at my other arm. It's covered with bits of rock.



As I'm removing these with the knife I push too hard and the blade goes through the skin near my wrist. I don't feel anything. That part of my arm must be dead. My right hand died long ago. It's now a dark blue colour. I push the knife through the skin of my thumb. There's a sound as some gas escapes, followed by a bad smell.



The arm is poisoned and the poison will kill me. I don't want the arm to be a part of me anymore. I throw myself against the boulder. When I look at my arm, I see that it's in a strange position.

That moment is like the sun coming out. I realise what it means. I can break my arm by using my own weight. That means I won't have to cut through bone anymore. I throw the whole weight of my body below the boulder. There is a loud noise. I keep going. There is a second loud noise. I've done it! I've broken both bones in my arm.

I tie the tourniquet, take the knife and begin cutting.

The only thing on my mind is escape, but the pain is terrible.

I scream as I push down with the knife.

For almost one hour the pain, screams, and cutting continue.



122 hrs 47 mins

11.32 am Finally, I feel the knife hit rock on the other side of my arm. I fall back with a single thought screaming through my head.



You've done it, Aron! You're FREE! FREE! FREE!



There's no time to lose. Blood is coming out of the end of my arm and it's a long walk back to my truck.



I tighten the tourniquet. Then I tie my climbing bag on my arm to hold it. I tighten it around my neck and put my things inside. Before I leave, I take two pictures of the part of my arm still trapped by the boulder. Now I am ready to go.



I can't walk straight. My body crashes from one side of the canyon wall to the other. I stop. My heart is going much too fast. I could still die at any moment. I make myself stay calm. What I need most of all is water. There might be some at the Big Drop Rappel, but first I need to get there.

It takes me twenty minutes. I stand at the edge and look down. It is just over eighteen metres to the canyon floor.



There are metal rings in the rock for climbers. I tie my rope to them and rappel down. With only one arm, this is not easy. For once, I am careful as I go down the rope. I reach the bottom and turn. On the ground in front of me is a pool of brown water. It's full of dead mosquitoes but I don't care. I fill my bottle and drink one litre in a few seconds. I drink another and don't want to move. I just want to stay there for the rest of my life.



That won't be long if you don't start walking. There are still twelve kilometres to go.

The voice is right. I drink one more litre, slowly this time. Then I fill my bottle and the CamelBak and begin walking. Blood is coming out faster from my arm now. I wonder if I can get back to the truck in time.



Things start to go wrong. I get lost up a side canyon and have to turn round. Then I notice that water is coming out of my CamelBak. There's a hole in it. Quickly, I drink the rest of the water. Now I only have the water in the water bottle. This has to last all the way back to the truck and the temperature is rising. I am so weak and tired I can't imagine surviving that long. I take a sip and keep the water in my mouth as I walk. That seems to help.



I still wonder if I can get back to my truck. I can't walk straight, I can't think for more than a few seconds, and I'm losing blood, fast.



125 hrs 10 mins

1.55 pm I've arrived at the Great Gallery. The paintings are amazing but all I can think of is water. There is more here.

I stop to fill the water bottle. It has taken me two and a half hours to travel six kilometres. For someone close to death I have done well. But my problems are getting worse every minute. Blood is now coming from my arm really fast and I'm in terrible pain from the amputation. I want to stop and rest, but I can't. I must go on.

I walk as fast as I can. By two-thirty, I have covered nearly ten kilometres. Only three more kilometres to my truck, but I'm feeling weaker every minute.



125 hrs 45 mins

2.30 pm I've come to another huge canyon. The walls must be over thirty metres high. Ahead of me is a steep hill. This is bad news. I'll never be able to climb it - I'm too weak. Something makes me look again. I shake my head, unable to believe what I see.

About seventy metres ahead of me are a family of three people - a man, a woman and a young boy. They are walking away from me.

'HELP! HELP! PLEASE! I NEED HELP!'

They turn and come running towards me.



When they reach me, I begin telling my story: 'My name is Aron Ralston. I was trapped by a boulder in the canyon for five days. This morning, I had to amputate my arm to escape. I need a doctor. I'm losing blood, fast...' Unable to continue, I fall to the ground.



The man gives me a bottle of water. 'The police at the carpark told us about you,' he says.

His name is Eric. His wife is Monique and his son is called Andy. They are tourists from the Netherlands. Eric gives me more water while Monique and Andy run back to get the police. After about ten minutes, Eric helps me up and we continue walking slowly.



The steep trail is ahead. Even with Eric's help, I know I won't be able to climb it. 'How will I ever get out of here?' I ask myself.





CHAPTER ELEVEN



127 hours



126 hrs 18 mins

3.03 pm A noise somewhere above me answers the question. It's a helicopter! A helicopter to take me to hospital. I can't believe it! It doesn't seem real. I sit down and wait as a man jumps to the ground and walks towards me.



'Are you Aron Ralston?' he asks.



'Yes.'

A second man gets out of the helicopter and they help me inside. I ask one of the men to get my climbing bag. Eric gives it to him.

'Thank you, Eric,' I say. 'Thanks for everything.' I wave goodbye as the helicopter rises into the air.



I sit behind the pilot and watch blood pour slowly down my arm.



Be strong, Aron. You're almost safe.

'Keep him talking,' the pilot says to his partner.

'Where are we going?' I ask the second man.

'We're taking you to the hospital in Moab,' he replies.

'How long will that take?'

'It's about twelve minutes from here.'

He asks me what happened in the canyon and I begin telling my story. By the time I finish, we are circling around Moab. I look down and see an area of green grass below.

This gets bigger as we move down towards it. I realise we are landing in front of the hospital. A man who looks like a policeman is standing with two nurses in white coats on the hospital steps. The helicopter lands and the nurses carry me into the building.

They put me in an empty room. The man walks in and introduces himself. 'Hi, Aron. I'm Steve, and I'm a Park Ranger.'

As the nurses take off my shoes, I ask Steve to let my mother know that I'm OK and to arrange for someone to collect all the things I left at Horseshoe Canyon.

'I'll do that when we've finished here,' Steve replies.

He wants to know what happened in the canyon. Once again, I tell my story. It's the third time I've done this in two hours. When I finish, I can see that Steve wants to ask me a lot of questions.

He doesn't get the chance. A doctor comes back into the room with a large needle.

'Wait!' I say as she goes to put it into my skin. 'I have a problem with needles. I sometimes go into shock. I fell out of a chair once.'



The doctor looks surprised. 'You mean you're not in shock already?'



'I don't know,' I reply.

'Look, do you want this for the pain or not?'



'Damn it, yes!' I say. I continue talking to Steve as the needle goes into my arm.





127 hrs



3.45 pm I suddenly hear another man's voice. He sounds like a doctor. He pulls at the things over my right arm and asks Steve what they are.

'There are a couple of tourniquets under there,' Steve replies.

'No, just one,' I whisper. I look at the clock on the wall.

It's 3.45 pm on Thursday, May the 1st. I realise that my nightmare has lasted for exactly 127 hours. It's my last thought before falling into a long, deep sleep.





EPILOGUE



My rescue was only the first part of a long, difficult fight back to health. In that first month, I had five operations. I was also taking eighteen different medicines a day. Most were for the pain and to fight the poison in my blood. While I was taking them, I couldn't do anything well. I couldn't sleep and my thoughts were unclear. After ten days in hospital, I went home. A week later, I was back in hospital in Denver for my fifth and most difficult operation. The time I woke up after the operation was the lowest point after my escape. I felt terrible. I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep and I was still in pain. Later, I discovered that I nearly died. However by May the 25th, I was home to stay.

The following weeks were difficult for my family. I was like a child again, unable to do anything for myself. Slowly, however, things got better. I was soon eating normal food and by the end of the summer, I was the same weight as before the accident.



By this time, I had a prosthetic arm. I learnt to use it quite well. I felt pleased. It wouldn't be long before I would be able to go climbing again. Of course, I didn't tell my mother that.



On August the 31st, four months after the accident, I spoke at Sonja's wedding. Four days later, I climbed Mount Moran in Wyoming with eight of my friends.

On October the 25th - two days before my twenty-eighth birthday - I returned to Blue John Canyon. Some friends, including Kristi Moore, were with me. We filmed the place where the accident happened. Then, as the others made their way back to their vehicles, I stayed behind for a few minutes. Just before I left, I looked at the dates of my life on the canyon wall. I was wrong. My life didn't end in the canyon. Thoughts of the people I love had kept me alive. If I wanted to see them again, I had to survive. That's what I told myself. And that's what I did.

My accident changed my life. I know that even if I could travel back in time, I wouldn't change anything. I would still say goodbye to Megan and Kristi and continue alone. I've learned a lot from that choice. I believe we are on Earth to do the things we love, even if that means making a hard choice. Sometimes, that means cutting out something and leaving it in the past. Saying goodbye to things from our past is also a new beginning.

It seemed a little too soft and a little too calming for everything that was going on. He wanted it to be nothing more than beautiful music coming from the innocent and pure joy of singing, but in the back of his mind, he knew it was likely some type of trap.
It all started with a random letter. Several of those were joined forces to create a random word. The words decided to get together and form a random sentence. They decided not to stop there and it wasn't long before a random paragraph had been cobbled together. The question was whether or not they could continue the momentum long enough to create a random short story.
The bowl was filled with fruit. It seemed to be an overabundance of strawberries, but it also included blueberries, raspberries, grapes, and banana slices. This was the meal Sarah had every morning to start her day since she could remember. Why she decided to add chocolate as an option today was still a bit of a surprise, but she had been in the process of deciding she wanted to change her routine. This was a baby step to begin that start.
The shades were closed keeping the room dark. Peter knew that he should open them and let in the sunlight so he could begin the day, but he didn't have the energy or willpower. Nothing had gone as expected the day before and he no longer wanted to spend the energy to begin a new day. He stared at the shades wondering if there was a way to disappear from the reality of the world for the rest of the day.
There weren't supposed to be dragons flying in the sky. First and foremost, dragons didn't exist. They were mythical creatures from fantasy books like unicorns. This was something that Pete knew in his heart to be true so he was having a difficult time acknowledging that there were actually fire-breathing dragons flying in the sky above him.
It was going to rain. The weather forecast didn't say that, but the steel plate in his hip did. He had learned over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman. It was going to rain, so he better get outside and prepare.
With six children in tow, Catherine raced to the airport departing gate. This wasn't an easy task as the children had other priorities than to get to the gate. She knew that she was tight on time and the frustration came out as she yelled at the kids to keep up. They continued to test her, pretending not to listen and to move in directions that only slowed them down. They had no idea the wrath they were about to receive when Catherine made it to the gate only to be informed that they had all missed the plane.
He knew what he was supposed to do. That had been apparent from the beginning. That was what made the choice so difficult. What he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same. This would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences, but he wasn't.
There was only half a worm in the apple. At first, Judy didn't quite comprehend what this meant. "Why would only half a worm be living in an apple?" she wondered. And then it dawned on her. Judy quickly spit out the bite she had just taken expecting to see the other half of the worm. It ended up being much worse than that.
The irony of the situation hadn't escaped her. She had taken years to sculpt the perfect persona with the perfect look that she shared on Instagram. She knew her hundreds of thousands of followers envied that life she showed and stayed engaged with her because they wanted that life too. The truth was that she wanted the perfect life she portrayed more than any of her fans. The fact was that despite all the perfection she shared on social media, her life was actually more of a mess than most.
Debbie knew she was being selfish and unreasonable. She understood why the others in the room were angry and frustrated with her and the way she was acting. In her eyes, it didn't really matter how they felt because she simply didn't care.
She looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen. She tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry. It hit her all at once. She was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear, sadness, and pride all running through her at the same time.
Do you think you're living an ordinary life? You are so mistaken it's difficult to even explain. The mere fact that you exist makes you extraordinary. The odds of you existing are less than winning the lottery, but here you are. Are you going to let this extraordinary opportunity pass?
The wave roared towards them with speed and violence they had not anticipated. They both turned to run but by that time it was too late. The wave crashed into their legs sweeping both of them off of their feet. They now found themselves in a washing machine of saltwater, getting tumbled and not know what was up or down. Both were scared, not knowing how this was going to end, but it was by far the best time of the trip thus far.
The drug seekers would come into the emergency room and scream about how much pain they were in. When you told them that you would start elevating their pain with Tylenol or Advil instead of a narcotic they became nasty and combative. They would start telling you what drug and dose they had to have to make their pain tolerable. After dealing with the same drug seekers several times a month it gets old. Some of the doctors would give in and give them a dose of morphine and send them away. Sure that was faster, but ethically she still couldn’t do it. Perhaps that’s why she had longer care times than the other doctors.
He watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence. There was no doubt that he was smart. The fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced, but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence.
Betty decided to write a short story and she was sure it was going to be amazing. She had already written it in her head and each time she thought about it she grinned from ear to ear knowing how wonderful it would be. She could imagine the accolades coming in and the praise she would receive for creating such a wonderful piece. She was therefore extremely frustrated when she actually sat down to write the short story and the story that was so beautiful inside her head refused to come out that way on paper.
"Explain to me again why I shouldn't cheat?" he asked. "All the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so. I should go about being happy losing to cheaters because I know that I don't? That's what you're telling me?"
She's asked the question so many times that she barely listened to the answers anymore. The answers were always the same. Well, not exactly the same, but the same in a general sense. A more accurate description was the answers never surprised her. So, she asked for the 10,000th time, "What's your favorite animal?" But this time was different. When she heard the young boy's answer, she wondered if she had heard him correctly.
Peter always saw the world in black and white. There were two choices for every situation and you had to choose one of them. It was therefore terribly uncomfortable for him to spend time with Ashley. She saw the world in shades of gray with hundreds of choices to choose from in every situation.
The time had come for Nancy to say goodbye. She had been dreading this moment for a good six months, and it had finally arrived despite her best efforts to forestall it. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't keep the inevitable from happening. So the time had come for a normal person to say goodbye and move on. It was at this moment that Nancy decided not to be a normal person. After all the time and effort she had expended, she couldn't bring herself to do it.
It was their first date and she had been looking forward to it the entire week. She had her eyes on him for months, and it had taken a convoluted scheme with several friends to make it happen, but he'd finally taken the hint and asked her out. After all the time and effort she'd invested into it, she never thought that it would be anything but wonderful. It goes without saying that things didn't work out quite as she expected.
They argue. While the argument seems to be different the truth is it's always the same. Yes, the topic may be different or the circumstances, but when all said and done, it all came back to the same thing. They both knew it, but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue. So they continue to argue.
Patricia's friend who was here hardly had any issues at all, but she wasn't telling the truth. Yesterday, before she left to go home, she heard that her husband is in the hospital and pretended to be surprised. It later came out that she was the person who had put him there.
The boxed moved. That was a problem. Peter had packed the box three hours before and there was nothing inside that should make it move. The question now was whether or not Peter was going to open it up and look inside to see why it had moved. The answer to that question was obvious. Peter dropped the package into the mailbox so he would never have to see it again.
The water rush down the wash and into the slot canyon below. Two hikers had started the day to sunny weather without a cloud in the sky, but they hadn't thought to check the weather north of the canyon. Huge thunderstorms had brought a deluge o rain and produced flash floods heading their way. The two hikers had no idea what was coming.
There was a leak in the boat. Nobody had yet noticed it, and nobody would for the next couple of hours. This was a problem since the boat was heading out to sea and while the leak was quite small at the moment, it would be much larger when it was ultimately discovered. John had planned it exactly this way.
He hid under the covers hoping that nobody would notice him there. It really didn't make much sense since it would be obvious to anyone who walked into the room there was someone hiding there, but he still held out hope. He heard footsteps coming down the hall and stop in front in front of the bedroom door. He heard the squeak of the door hinges and someone opened the bedroom door. He held his breath waiting for whoever was about to discover him, but they never did.
The boy walked down the street in a carefree way, playing without notice of what was about him. He didn't hear the sound of the car as his ball careened into the road. He took a step toward it, and in doing so sealed his fate.
It was difficult for him to admit he was wrong. He had been so certain that he was correct and the deeply held belief could never be shaken. Yet the proof that he had been incorrect stood right before his eyes. "See daddy, I told you that they are real!" his daughter excitedly proclaimed.
The clowns had taken over. And yes, they were literally clowns. Over 100 had appeared out of a small VW bug that had been driven up to the bank. Now they were all inside and had taken it over.
One can cook on and with an open fire. These are some of the ways to cook with fire outside. Cooking meat using a spit is a great way to evenly cook meat. In order to keep meat from burning, it's best to slowly rotate it. Hot stones can be used to toast bread. Coals are hot and can bring things to a boil quickly. If one is very adventurous, one can make a hole in the ground, fill it with coals and place foil-covered meat, veggies, and potatoes into the coals, and cover all of it with dirt. In a short period of time, the food will be baked. Campfire cooking can be done in many ways.
She counted. One. She could hear the steps coming closer. Two. Puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth. Three. He stopped beside her. Four. She pulled the trigger of the gun.
He walked down the steps from the train station in a bit of a hurry knowing the secrets in the briefcase must be secured as quickly as possible. Bounding down the steps, he heard something behind him and quickly turned in a panic. There was nobody there but a pair of old worn-out shoes were placed neatly on the steps he had just come down. Had he past them without seeing them? It didn't seem possible. He was about to turn and be on his way when a deep chill filled his body.
The song came from the bathroom belting over the sound of the shower's running water. It was the same way each day began since he could remember. It listened intently and concluded that the singing today was as terrible as it had ever been.
I'm heading back to Colorado tomorrow after being down in Santa Barbara over the weekend for the festival there. I will be making October plans once there and will try to arrange so I'm back here for the birthday if possible. I'll let you know as soon as I know the doctor's appointment schedule and my flight plans.
He couldn't remember exactly where he had read it, but he was sure that he had. The fact that she didn't believe him was quite frustrating as he began to search the Internet to find the article. It wasn't as if it was something that seemed impossible. Yet she insisted on always seeing the source whenever he stated a fact.
April seriously wondered about her sleeping partner choices. She looked at her bed and what a mess it had become. How did she get to the point in her life where she had two dogs, three cats, and a raccoon sleeping with her every night?
It's an unfortunate reality that we don't teach people how to make money (beyond getting a 9 to 5 job) as part of our education system. The truth is there are a lot of different, legitimate ways to make money. That doesn't mean they are easy and that you won't have to work hard to succeed, but it does mean that if you're willing to open your mind a bit you don't have to be stuck in an office from 9 to 5 for the next fifty years o your life.
The headphones were on. They had been utilized on purpose. She could hear her mom yelling in the background, but couldn't make out exactly what the yelling was about. That was exactly why she had put them on. She knew her mom would enter her room at any minute, and she could pretend that she hadn't heard any of the previous yelling.
The trail to the left had a "Danger! Do Not Pass" sign telling people to take the trail to the right. This wasn't the way Zeke approached his hiking. Rather than a warning, Zeke read the sign as an invitation to explore an area that would be adventurous and exciting. As the others in the group all shited to the right, Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would later regret.
I've rented a car in Las Vegas and have reserved a hotel in Twentynine Palms which is just north of Joshua Tree. We'll drive from Las Vegas through Mojave National Preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down. Then spend all day on Monday at Joshua Tree. We can decide the next morning if we want to do more in Joshua Tree or Mojave before we head back.
He took a sip of the drink. He wasn't sure whether he liked it or not, but at this moment it didn't matter. She had made it especially for him so he would have forced it down even if he had absolutely hated it. That's simply the way things worked. She made him a new-fangled drink each day and he took a sip of it and smiled, saying it was excellent.
How had she been so wrong? All her instincts and intuition completely failed her for the first time in her life. She had so heavily relied on both when making decisions up until this moment and she felt a seismic shift take place in her self-confidence. If she could be so completely wrong about something so simple as this, how could she make decisions about really important things taking place in her life? She wasn't sure what she should do next.
It was a question of which of the two she preferred. On the one hand, the choice seemed simple. The more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most. It was the easy choice. The safe choice. But she wasn't sure she actually preferred it.
Love isn't always a ray of sunshine. That's what the older girls kept telling her when she said she had found the perfect man. She had thought this was simply bitter talk on their part since they had been unable to find true love like hers. But now she had to face the fact that they may have been right. Love may not always be a ray of sunshine. That is unless they were referring to how the sun can burn.
There were a variety of ways to win the game. James had played it long enough to know most of them and he could see what his opponent was trying to do. There was a simple counterattack that James could use and the game should be his. He began deploying it with the confidence of a veteran player who had been in this situation a thousand times in the past. So, it was with great surprise when his opponent used a move he had never before seen or anticipated to easily defeat him in the game.
She tried not to judge him. His ratty clothes and unkempt hair made him look homeless. Was he really the next Einstein as she had been told? On the off chance it was true, she continued to try not to judge him.
It was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life. While everyone around him was in tears and upset, he actually felt more at ease. The doctor said it would be less than a year. That gave him a year to live, something he'd failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then.
There was a time and a place for Stephanie to use her magic. The problem was that she had a difficult time determining this. She wished she could simply use it when the desire hit and there wouldn't be any unforeseen consequences. Unfortunately, that's not how it worked and the consequences could be devastating if she accidentally used her magic at the wrong time.
